In our dataset, a number of smoke or non-smoke data is missing. So our goal is to find wether the data is come from smoke or non-smoke and their parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$.Assume Smoker ~ $N(\mu_1,\sigma_1^2)$, Non-Smoke ~ $N(\mu_2,\sigma_2^2)$ 
$\theta_1=[\mu_1,\sigma_1]^T$
$\theta_2=[\mu_2,\sigma_2]^T$
$\theta=[\theta_1,\theta_2]$ --> the parameter need to be estimate. 
Let $Z$ be the missing data, and set when $z=1$,the data comes from smoke, else when $z=0$ comes from non-smoke. 

set initial parameters:
$\mu_1=2000$, $\mu_2=1000$,$\sigma_1=100$, $\sigma_2=100$. 

We need to design a cut-off point C, based on the normal gragh, to determine $x_i$ belongs to which group, somker or non-smoker.

After grouping our initial data, we can calculate the MLE of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ for both group. 

Then we use $\hat \mu$ and $\hat \sigma$ to re-seclect group. We use Newtow iteration method until $\hat \mu = \mu$ and $\hat \sigma = \sigma$.

Finally, we will have mean cost and variance for smoker and non-smoker.
